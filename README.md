### about me
By nature thrilled by new challenges and learning new things, I have been involved in software development and business consultancy for several years.
I held positions of Team Lead, Technical Lead and Software Developer, engaged in projects on behalf of Ministries and companies among the largest in Italy.
During my career, I was in charge of interviewing/hiring developers and following young people through the technical training process.
I am a point of reference for my managers and for Junior resources.
